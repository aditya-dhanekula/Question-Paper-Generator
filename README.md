# Question-Paper-Generator

INTRODUCTION:
We aim to reduce the time and effort the teachers and faculties put in preparing the question
paper for different subjects, concepts, chapters, difficulty levels and much more. We want to
design a system to generate question paper from the question bank added to the system.
The difficulty level and weightage of the question paper can be balanced with ease. Multiple
sets of papers with uniform complexity can be created in no time.
