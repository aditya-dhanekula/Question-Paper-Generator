# Question-Paper-Generator

INTRODUCTION:
We aim to reduce the time and effort the teachers and faculties put in preparing the question
paper for different subjects, concepts, chapters, difficulty levels and much more. We want to
design a system to generate question paper from the question bank added to the system.
The difficulty level and weightage of the question paper can be balanced with ease. Multiple
sets of papers with uniform complexity can be created in no time.
Project Description:
Generation of Question Paper for various subjects in the user-specified format by picking
questions randomly from question bank added to the system.
● Question paper can be generated for multiple subjects.
● Question paper format of the subject, chapter, complexity, marking scheme, and the
number of questions can be specified.
● The system generates a question paper by picking random questions following the
format.
● Subjects and chapters can be managed, i.e., viewed, added, edited and removed.
● Question Bank can be created by specifying the respective subject, chapter, the marking
scheme, the difficulty level of the question, and the corresponding answer key.
● Adding, removing, and editing the questions is supported.
● The structure of the question paper is taken as input from the user.
● The question paper structure includes the details regarding the subject, chapter, no of
questions from each chapter and the marking scheme.
● The system generates a question paper following the given specifications by randomly
picking the questions from the question bank.
● Additional provisions like loading questions from a data file and saving them to a data file
are supported.
● The output question paper with/without the key can be saved to a file.
